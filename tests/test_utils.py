    A towel, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] says, is about the most
    massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it
    has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you
    bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant
    marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you
    can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert
    world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy
    River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your
    head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the
    Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-boggingly stupid
    animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't
    see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress
    signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems
    to be clean enough.
